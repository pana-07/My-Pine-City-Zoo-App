                <h3>Elephant</h3>
                <p>Elephants are the biggest animals that walk on land! They have long, bendy noses called trunks that they use like a super-tool â€“ to grab leaves, suck up water for a drink or shower, and even say hello to friends. Elephants love their families and live together in big groups. They have huge, flappy ears to keep cool and long, strong teeth called tusks. Elephants are very smart and gentle giants.
<p>Question:
What is one special thing an elephant can do with its trunk?</p>
<h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h4>

You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
