                <h3>elephant</h3>
            <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for their intelligence, strong memory, and large ears.</p> 
              <p> Elephants are herbivores, meaning they eat only plants. Their diet includes grass, leaves, fruits, and bark. They use their trunks to grab food and bring it to their mouths.</p>
